# AdvancementsFullscreen

This simple mod expands the advancements window to full screen. It does not require Fabric API or other mods.

### Any extra features?

Never. This is made for those who only want a large window without any additional functionality.

### How is this different from other mods?

[AdvancementInfo](https://modrinth.com/mod/advancementinfo) - adds information about the remaining criteria for completing advancements, but expanding the window is just a bonus.

[Better Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-advancements) - adds so many features, not only expanding the window.

[Advancements Enlarger](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancements-enlarger) - expands the window, but does it in a way that will cause conflicts with other mods that also do something in the this window.

[AdvancementsFullscreen](https://modrinth.com/project/advancementsfullscreen) - expands the window, but does nothing else and does not create conflicts for other mods, and also fixes some visual bugs that all the mods above have.

### Support with other mods?

Never. I believe that all existing popular mods that do anything in the advancements window are designed incorrectly. They add several functions at once, some of which the player may not need.

Instead, I will be developing [my own set of mods for advancements window](https://modrinth.com/collection/zUiqKAl3). Each of them will add by one feature and will be fully compatible with each other.
