# AdvancementsFullscreen

This simple mod expands the advancements window to full screen. It does not require Fabric API or other mods. 

### Any extra features?

Never. This is made for those who only want a large window without any additional functionality.

### Support with other mods?

Never. I believe that all existing popular mods that do anything in the advancements window are designed incorrectly. They add several functions at once, some of which the player may not need.

Instead, I will be developing [my own set of mods for advancements window](https://modrinth.com/collection/zUiqKAl3). Each of them will add by one feature and will be fully compatible with each other.
